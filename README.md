# advent-calender-2022
Participating in the "Advent of Code 2022", each day introducing a small coding puzzle

The event: https://adventofcode.com/2022/about

My goal is to strengthen my newly learned Python skills. I try to focus on keeping my functions short and testeable and classes coherent. 

I try not to spend too much time on each puzzle since I have other projects and things to do. I'm happy if I can complete a puzzle in one hour, max two.
